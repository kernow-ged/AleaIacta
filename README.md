# AleaIacta

RPG dice roller for Android devices. 

Basically an Android wrapper (Eclipse project) for a simple HTML5 app found in the assets folder.

Default dice: standard polyhedrals from d4 through to d%, also Fudge/Fate dice and FU RPG-style oracle dice ("yes/no/yes and/yes but/no and/no but").

Define and add your own dice with numeric or text faces. Mix and match dice and add a static modifier to build dice pools.
